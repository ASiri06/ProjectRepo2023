## What have we done so far?
We started our project with installing all needed programs and signing into the online applications: 
* InteliJ- to write all our code.
* GitHub- to store and share the code.
* Jira- to plan our project in scrum method.
* Slack- to cooperate and help each other with other group members. 

Then we created the repository in The GitHub and cloned it into our machine.
We then created Maven project and saved it in the earlier created repository.
The next step was to install the dependencies in our pom.xml file. We required **Junit, Selenium-Java, Cucumber-Java and Cucumber-Junit.**
Once we done that we had to make a BDD framework and created the packages in srs/main/test/java:
* browserControl
*  features
*  pageObjects
*  stepDefinitions
*  utilities
